Visualizing models & profiles 
   1) graphics2 is an IDL procedure to allow visualize the Stokes profiles and
          model atmospheres resulting from SIR. It is invoked within IDL 
          by typing graphics2. 
          It uses a file called scales which sets the axes of the different 
          plots. The scaling is automatic, but can be optimized manually. 
          
        graphics.pro  is the same, but should works independently of the screen size 
          
   IMPORTANT: you should cp or mv the scales file to your ~/bin folder    
          

Reading & Writing SIR format
  1) read_model.pro and  write_model.pro read and write model files [model].mod

  2) read_profile.pro and write_profile.pro read and write profile files [profile].per

  3) read_RF.pro reads Response Function files [model].rft, [model.rfb], [model].rfg, etc., 
     for the 4 Stokes parameters evaluated in models containing a non null magnetic field
  
  4) read_RF_nomag.pro reads Response Function files [model].rft, [model.rfb], [model].rfg, etc., 
     for the Stokes I evaluated in models without magnetic field.

Other tools
  1) Pg_PeT.pro  procedure that calling the program [SIR folder]/PgmufromPeT_i.x evaluates Pg (and many thermodinamical parameters) from T & Pe
  2) Pe_PgT.pro  procedure that calling the program [SIR folder]/PemufromPgT_i.x evaluates Pe (and many thermodinamical parameters) from T & Pg
  3) Pgderivatives.pro  procedure that calling the program [SIR folder]/Pgderivatives_i.x evaluates Pg and the derivatives dlogPg/dT and dlogPg/dPe
  4) add_noise.pro adds noise to a profile
  5) introduce_points.pro reads a profile and write again but in a new wavelength grid, in such a way
     that in new points a value -1 it is written 
  6) sensitivity.pro reading  Stokes_obs and Stokes_syn, model and RF written for a given parameters
     evaluates the uncertainties of that parameter

Atlas
  1) ftsidl.pro routine allows the extraction of individual spectral lines from
     the FTS atlas provided by the KIS IDL library. This atlas gives the intensity 
     spectrum of the quiet sun at disk center as measured with the Fourier 
     Transform Spectrometer at the McMacth-Pierce telescope on Kitt Peak. 
     FTSIDL produces files containing the profiles and the corresponding 
     wavelength grids ready to be used by SIR.
     
Ambiguity
  1) desam_brc.pro solve the 180 degrees ambiguity
