You can find 
SIR2017.tar.gz 

and the following folders:

1) manual. This folder contains a manual describing SIR, how to install and run the code.

2) models. Here you will find some standard model atmospheres which may be of use in
real inversions. A number of utilities for modifying these models or others are provided
as well.

3) default. This folder keeps default files (as abundance, atomic parameters, grids and sir.trol files) 

4) test. This subdirectory contains a particular inversion intended to test the degree of
success of the installation.

5) idl. Several IDL procedures for visualizing model atmospheres and Stokes profiles.
There are also some utilities for extracting observed profiles from the IDL FTS spectral
atlas.

6 Barklem. Several files to evaluate collisional (pressure) broadening parameters
\alpha  and \sigma resulting from the quantum mechanical theory of Anstee, Barklem, and O?Mara.
It includes the file table1 with a large list of spectral lines, the original Barklem program
widthcom.f and some useful references.


You will also find a file (compiling_running.txt) describing how to compile, link and run 
both SIR and modelador3.x programs.
