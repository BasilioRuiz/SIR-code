Test of SIR intallation

To run a test please create a new directory and copy the files
in SIR_input_files there.

Then run 
echo sir.trol | [path]/sir.x

It should generate the files that you can find in
SIR_output_files (except model2.per that it is there only for checking)

In this run the program try to find the model that best reproduce
the profiles in model1.per (which were sintetised from model1.mod).
So the final model (model2_4.mod in our case) should be similar to
model1.mod, and the final profile (model2_4.per in our case) similar
to model1.per
